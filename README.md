# AD Guardian

Hi,

welcome to **AD Guardian**—my personal tool built to monitor and test Active Directory health in a smart, automated, and user‑friendly way. I created this project to simplify routine AD checks, schedule tests, and send detailed email notifications so you can always stay on top of your environment. I hope you find it useful!
