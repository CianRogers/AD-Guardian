# AD Guardian

Hi,

welcome to **AD Guardian**—my personal tool built to monitor and test Active Directory health in a smart, automated, and user-friendly way. I created this project to simplify routine AD checks, schedule tests, and send detailed email notifications so you can always stay on top of your environment. I hope you find it useful!

## Features

- **Scheduled Tests:**  
  Automatically run health checks on your domain controllers on a schedule.

- **Custom Popups:**  
  Get immediate visual notifications with detailed results and log viewing options.

- **Email Notifications:**  
  Receive well-formatted HTML emails summarizing test results—automatically sent when tests complete.

- **Detailed Logging:**  
  Logs for every test are saved, viewable, and exportable for your records.

- **Modern User Interface:**  
  A clean, modern, animated UI built with WPF for a smooth monitoring experience.
